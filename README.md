# Realtime Paint using opencv-python.

## Two modes:
1. Draw (Usual paint with four colors and clear feature)
2. Magic (Rainbow brush disappears after sometime)

## Working
Default brush is a light blue pen cap, and the lighting shouldn't be too bright.

## Custom
If you want to change your brush, you can check your HSV value by running color_detector.py and change its value in magicpen.py manually.
